    "description": "My work is rooted in a fascination with the contrast between beauty and decay, tradition and rebellion.\nI create handcrafted bone jewelry and leather accessories that draw inspiration from dark western aesthetic, where the wild, the worn, and the mysterious meet.\nEach piece is shaped by hand, using natural bone, high quality leather, and metal details to capture a sense of time and texture.\nWhat draws me to bone as a material is its quiet honesty.\nIt carries history, fragility, and resilience all at once. Combined with leather and metal, it creates a language of its own.\nSomething tactile and raw, yet deliberate. My designs often explore this balance, finding beauty in what feels rough or forgotten.\nAt the Duystere Markt, you’ll find a collection of belts, bags, jewellery and different leather accessoires crafted by yours truly.\nThe pieces are made to be worn, to age with you, and to carry a certain presence.\nI create designs for those who feel drawn to objects with weight and texture, who find meaning in the in-between spaces: between wildness and calm, darkness and light.",

The materials—primarily ethically sourced bones from natural hunting byproducts and recycled copper—carry both history and meaning.\nNothing is taken without purpose; instead, discarded materials are transformed into lasting art.\nEvery stage of the process honors the natural cycle of life and death, turning remnants into symbols of renewal and transformation.\nNo two pieces are ever the same. Each creation is shaped intuitively, guided by texture, form, and story.\nThe result is jewelry that feels alive—raw, powerful, and deeply personal.\nThese are not ornaments of vanity but talismans of intent: wearable art for those who seek connection between the material and the metaphysical.\nSolve & Coagula Design stands firmly against mass production. Every item is made slowly, thoughtfully, and with intention.\nThe brand believes in sustainability not as a trend, but as a responsibility—to the earth, to craft, and to the people who wear its creations.\nInspired by occult philosophy, alchemy, and the beauty found in decay, Solve & Coagula Design invites you to embrace imperfection and authenticity.\nEach piece tells its own story, waiting to become part of yours.\n\nHandmade. Ethical. Unique.\nSolve & Coagula Design—transforming the remnants of nature into timeless, meaningful art.",

Every piece I craft is shaped from genuine leather, cut, carved, and dyed by hand in my workshop.\nMy inspiration comes from the whispering woods, ancient legends, and the creatures that dwell between light and shadow.\nYou may recognize the touch of the Celts, the echoes of the Vikings, or the raw spirit of the medieval age woven through each design.\nAt De Duystere Markt, I bring with me a collection of handcrafted treasures: bracers and pauldrons that feel as though they’ve seen battle, corset belts that lend strength and shape, pouches and drink horn holders for travelers on long roads, and masks that conceal or reveal your truest self.\nEach piece carries its own story, some delicate, others fierce – waiting for the right soul to claim them.\nBut perhaps you seek something that doesn’t yet exist.\nA token that reflects your own legend, your character, your path.\nIf so, come speak with me. I gladly take on custom commissions, working together to forge a piece that feels as though it was meant for you and you alone.\nSo step into the dim glow of Studio Fade, breathe in the scent of leather and adventure, and find the gear that will carry you into your next tale.",

Worn by those who dare to stand apart and express your own magic.",

We combine our designs with folklore tales and old engraving art, creating a place sometimes dark, sometimes brutal - but always human. \n\nIn our small universe you can find tshirts, hoodies, random clothing pieces, a tarot deck, books, or whatever our disquiet mind decides to devise.  Where every item tells a story to make you curious again - something to read and talk about!\n\nCredo quia absurdum is like a personal Aether - the duality of a volatile and fixed thing, with all elements and substances coexisting, hopefully strong enough to challenge and unsettle your psyche.",
